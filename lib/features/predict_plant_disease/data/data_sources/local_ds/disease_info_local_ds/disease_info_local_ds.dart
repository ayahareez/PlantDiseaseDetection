      diseaseOverview:
          'Early blight is a common fungal disease affecting potatoes caused by the fungus Alternaria solani . It usually appears during warm, humid weather conditions.',
      diseaseCauses:
          'Spread through infected plant debris, soil, and windborne spores. Favored by high humidity, prolonged leaf wetness, and warm temperatures.',
      diseasePrevention:
          'Crop Rotation: Avoid planting potatoes in the same location for consecutive years.Resistant Varieties: Choose potato varieties resistant to early blight.Spacing: Proper plant spacing for adequate air circulation.Fungicides: Apply fungicides preventatively or at the first sign of symptoms.',
      diseaseRecovery:
          'Pruning: Remove and destroy infected leaves and stems to prevent further spread.Copper-Based Sprays: Use copper-based fungicides to control the disease.Fertilization: Maintain balanced soil fertility to promote plant vigor.Mulching: Apply organic mulch to reduce soil splash onto foliage.',

          'Late blight is a devastating potato disease caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans.Infamous for its role in the Irish Potato Famine in the 19th century.Flourishes in cool, moist conditions.',
      diseaseCauses:
          'Pathogen Survival: Spores survive in infected plant debris and can spread rapidly.Weather Conditions: Thrives in cool, wet weather, especially during periods of high humidity.',
      diseasePrevention:
          'Resistant Varieties: Plant potato varieties with resistance to late blight.Fungicides: Regular applications of fungicides, especially during periods of high disease pressure.Spacing and Ventilation: Proper plant spacing and ventilation to reduce humidity around plants.Early Detection: Regularly inspect plants and act promptly if symptoms are observed.',
      diseaseRecovery:
          'Pruning and Removal: Trim affected foliage and remove infected plant parts to prevent further spread.Copper-Based Fungicides: Application of copper-based fungicides to slow down the disease progression.Cultural Practices: Ensure proper soil drainage and avoid excessive watering.Post-Harvest Inspection: Carefully inspect harvested tubers, and discard any showing signs of infection.',

          'Bacterial Spot is a common bacterial disease affecting peaches, caused by Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni.Thrives in warm and humid conditions, with significant impact on fruit quality and yield.',
      diseaseCauses:
          'Bacterial Spread: Easily spreads through rain splashes, contaminated equipment, and pruning tools.Warm and Humid Climate: Flourishes in temperatures between 75°F and 85°F (24°C to 29°C) with high humidity.',
      diseasePrevention:
          'Resistant Varieties: Plant peach varieties resistant to bacterial spot.Sanitation: Practice good sanitation, including cleaning tools and pruning equipment.Copper-Based Sprays: Apply copper-based bactericides preventatively during the growing season.Proper Pruning: Prune trees to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage.',
      diseaseRecovery:
          'Copper Sprays: Apply copper-based sprays to control bacterial spot after symptoms appear.Remove Infected Parts: Prune and destroy infected branches and leaves to prevent further spread.Fungicidal Applications: Use bactericides in conjunction with fungicides for effective control.Cultural Practices: Adjust irrigation to minimize leaf wetness and promote soil drainage.',

          'Black Rot is a fungal disease affecting apple trees, caused by the pathogen Botryosphaeria obtusa.Common in warm and humid conditions, it primarily affects fruit but can also impact leaves and twigs.',
      diseaseCauses:
          'Fungal Spread: Spores spread through rain, wind, and splashing water.Warm and Wet Conditions: Thrives in temperatures between 75°F and 85°F (24°C to 29°C) with prolonged leaf wetness.',
      diseasePrevention:
          'Resistant Varieties: Plant apple varieties resistant to Black Rot.Fungicide Applications: Apply fungicides preventatively, especially during critical growth stages.Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected fruit, leaves, and prunings to reduce overwintering sources.Pruning: Open up the tree canopy to improve air circulation.',
      diseaseRecovery:
          'Fungicidal Treatments: Apply fungicides at the first signs of Black Rot to limit its spread.Pruning Infected Parts: Trim and remove infected branches and fruit to prevent further infections.Cultural Practices: Adjust irrigation to reduce leaf wetness and promote soil drainage.Post-Harvest Inspection: Carefully inspect harvested apples, discarding any with Black Rot symptoms.',

          'Description: Apple scab is a common fungal disease caused by the pathogen Venturia inaequalis.Appearance: It manifests as dark, scaly lesions on leaves, fruit, and twigs.Favorable Conditions: Thrives in cool, wet conditions, and its spores spread through rain and wind.',
      diseaseCauses:
          'Fungal Spread: Spores are disseminated by rain, wind, and splashing water.Humid Conditions: Flourishes in high humidity and temperatures around 60-75°F (15-24°C).',
