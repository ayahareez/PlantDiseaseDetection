          'Resistant Varieties: Plant potato varieties with resistance to late blight.Fungicides: Regular applications of fungicides, especially during periods of high disease pressure.Spacing and Ventilation: Proper plant spacing and ventilation to reduce humidity around plants.Early Detection: Regularly inspect plants and act promptly if symptoms are observed.',
      diseaseRecovery:
          'Pruning and Removal: Trim affected foliage and remove infected plant parts to prevent further spread.Copper-Based Fungicides: Application of copper-based fungicides to slow down the disease progression.Cultural Practices: Ensure proper soil drainage and avoid excessive watering.Post-Harvest Inspection: Carefully inspect harvested tubers, and discard any showing signs of infection.',
